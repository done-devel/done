# Release

## Flatpak
To test the build for Flatpak, read [this](../FLATPAK.md).

To make a release, run [`flatpak.sh`](flatpak.sh), take the files and upload them to the new release. 

Once they are uploaded, edit [`dev.edfloreshz.Done.json`](https://github.com/flathub/dev.edfloreshz.Done) and change the link and the hash.

Push the changes.

## Arch Linux
Update the PKGCONFIG to include the newest release `pkgrel` and `pkgver`.

## Windows
To compile for Windows, we need to configure Docker:

### Setup
To install Docker in Ubuntu:
```bash
sudo apt install docker-io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

We'll make use of an image in DockerHub.

```bash
docker pull mglolenstine/gtk4-cross:rust-gtk-4.6
```

Once it downloads, we need to create a container inside the project:
```bash
docker run -ti -v $(pwd):/mnt mglolenstine/gtk4-cross:rust-gtk-4.6
```

Once inside, we need to run `build` to build the project and `package` to package it into a zip file.

After that we'll have a `package.zip` in the root directory.

## macOS
macOS support is still on the way.
